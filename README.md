# 👋 Hi there, I’m Intissar Gourainy

🎓 I’m a Computer Science graduate passionate about solving problems with Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning.  
🛰️ My final-year research focused on automating the extraction and analysis of CubeSat mission data using NLP.

I enjoy working on projects at the intersection of space, data, and language, building tools that make messy information structured, visual, and useful.

### What I Worked On

- **Capstone Project**: Applied NLP techniques (regex, TF-IDF, cosine similarity) to extract mission data from text, APIs, and websites (scraping)  
- Structured the output into a Supabase PostgreSQL database  
- Visualized results and built a React.js dashboard  
- Focus areas: Rule-based NLP, data modeling, exploratory visualization
